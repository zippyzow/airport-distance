#Discription
This app calculates the distance between two US airports in miles. The user chooses both a 'from' and a 'to' airport
based on the airport code, city, or name. The user can clear the airports and the mileage will update as long as two
airports are selected. The map reflects the location(s) of the airport(s).

#Run
To run, open public/index.html in browser.

Node script to parse airports.csv into a JSON file. This data is copied into airport-factory.js for the purpose of this demo.
